# Homework-1-Code-Refactor

For this homework assignment, the client has asked that the codebase of their website follows accessibilty standards so that it is optimized for SEO. 

In response to this goal, I have made changes to improve and consoidate both the HTML and CSS for their website. The HTML was riddled with non-semantic HTML and contained a lot of div tags that were unclear. I've made the HTML more semantic by replacing div tags with section, article, figure, header, and footer tags. These semantic tags adhear to accessiblity standards, unlike the generic div tags. 
  
I've also made some small changes to clean up the code. For example, I removed redundant ID's that were not contributing the functionality of the website. The CSS also was not in a consistent order with the HTML, so I rearranged it so that the CSS selectors and their corresponding HTML elements fall in a sequential order. Also, changing the div elements in HTML to the new header and footer elements eliminated the need for the 'class="header"' and 'class="footer"' identifiers, which lead to the need for some slight editing of the CSS (i.e. changing '.header' to 'header). 

The biggest problem I was not able to solve is how to make the header span across the entire width of the viewport. I tried a few different things and nothing seemed to work.
  
In the end, the changes I have made to the site's HTML and CSS code follow the outlined Acceptance Critera and meet accessibilty standards, which will make the client's website more optomized for search engines.
